<h2>Legend of the mythical Island of <br/>Sete Cidades (and it's various versions)</h2>
</div>
<div class="paragrafo">
<p>The suppositio of an Legendary Island of the Sete Cidades (also called by <em>Antillia</em> or <em>Antilia</em>) situated somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean
to the west of Europe, inspired for many centuries the exploration of the sea. The nomenclature derives from "<em>Insula Seenem Civitatum</em>", which means
"Island of The Seven Tribes" or "Island of the Seven". However, in modern languages it came to be definitively called Island of the Sete Cidades, which names were <em>Aira</em>,
<em>Antuab</em>, <em>Ansalli</em>, <em>Ansesseli</em>, <em>Ansodi</em>, <em>Ansolli</em> and <em>Con</em>. These cities date back to classical latin sources, probably based
on earlier traditions of the Mediterranean people, notably the Phoenicians (civilization whose epicenter
was in present-day Lebanon, Syria and northern Israel).
<br/><br/> The first Iberian document referring to the supposed Island of the Seven Cities is a chronicle in Latin
of the city of Porto Cale (the modern city of Porto), apparently written around 750 AD by a Christian cleric.
<br/>At that time,
the Iberian kingdom of the Visigoths had already collapsed under the pressure of the Muslim invasion (which begun in AD 711) which had advanced as far north as the peninsular. The Archbishop
of Porto-Cale, with the objective of avoiding the Muslim domain, equated to depart for the great land of Sete cidades (<em>Sete Civitates</em>), which existence had been secured to him by
well-known sailors.<br/> </br/> In 734, the archbishop embarked on a fleet of twenty sailboats, accompanied by other prelates (a title of honor attributed to certain ecclesiastics who
hold high positions within the Catholic Church), to which were added five thousand faithful. Despite the chronicle narrating that the fleet came safely to its destination,
and that, because of this, many people were preparing to follow it, the truth is that the archbishop's trail, if it ever existed, was completely lost.

<h3>Supposed geographical position of the island:</h3>
<br/>
<p>Despite the lack of proven contacts with the island of Sete Cidades, the belief in its existence gave rise to one of the most publicized legends of the European Middle Ages. In fact,
there are multiple visual reports and the supposed organization of several expeditions aiming to find it. Almost all of the medieval sea maps of the current Atlantic showed its position,
although it varied.<br/><br/>
With the arrival of the epoch of discoveries, the reports of visual registers and the attempts of possession of the island multiplied. One of the most consistent cases was
a letter presented in 1473 to King D. Afonso V of Portugal by the azorean Fernão Teles. This letter consisted of a long coastline, with several islands, bays and rivers, which he declared to be part of the Sete Cidades (although it is believed that this zone could be the northern coast of Brazil, between Maranhão and Ceará, with the delta of the Parnaíba river, the only assurance is that the territory was situated on the western shore of the Atlantic).
<br/><br/>Apparently the king will not have fully believed in the discovery, or not
considered Fernão Teles sufficiently dignified, reason why the letter of donation granted to the azorean does not have any reference to the Sete Cidades but only to a great western island. Fernao Teles insisted the mythical legend, consulting the cosmographer Paolo del Pozzo Toscanelli (1398-1492),
who stated that the
Antília
 (designation given to the islands present in the Caribbean Sea) and the Island of the Sete Cidades would be on that part of the Atlantic. Finally, in 1476 the donation to explore the island
was granted, but there is no known existence of any subsequent shipment.
<br/><br/>However, among the most well documented expeditions is the one that flemish
Ferdinand Van Olm (known in azorean historiography as Fernando de Ulmo or Fernão Dulmo) led. These adventurer, which were linked to Fernão de Teles by the conditiono of genro, received
in 1486 autorization of the king João II of Portugal to search of to the search of the whereabouts of the island. Fernão partened with a madeiran named Afonso do Estreito and organizated
an expedition, destined to the conquest of the supposed lost island. Unfortunately, Fernão Dulmo had no better luck than his predecessors, but even so, in the seventeenth century, an expedition
was organized in Terceira island to explore the ocean to the northwest of the archipelago, where an unknown island was
supposedly been sighted.<br/><br/> In the Azores survives to this day the legend of the enchanted island that can only be
around June 24, being in that period the sightseeing of unknown islands in the horizon, being in fact just fog and
clouds. Regarding the final considerations about the Island of Sete Cidades, it is in fact the name of one of the greatest volcanoes of the Atlantic,
with its two lagoons. This in addition to the multiple non-azorean references, legends and also stories.</p>
